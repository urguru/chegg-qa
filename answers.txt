p++

Here p is a pointer to an integer
And the pointers are always of the size of an integer
So the statement increments the value of p by 2 since the size of an integer is 2

Answer is B 

13.

An array created during the execution of a program is called a dynamic array

So the correct option is d. Dynamic


14. Having a destructor avoids the memory leak when we have pointer variables inn our class

So the correct option is option d. memory

15.

The correct answer is option d. adding an overloaded = operator

The shallow copy happens by default so if we want the deep copy to happen then in in overloaded = operation we have to create a new memory space for the pointer and then store the values

16.
The correct answer is option d. All the above

A copy constructor gets automatically executed when 
1. An object is decalred and initialised by using the value of another object
2.When an object is passed by value as a parameter
3.When the return value of a function is an object

17.When we make a deep copy what happens is that we allocate new memory to the pointer that we are copying the values into so the pointer will have its own memory space and a different address.Both the pointers will not be pointing to the same address

So the correct answer will be ................each pointer refers to a different address
