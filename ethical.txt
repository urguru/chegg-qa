The kind of action taken by Charlie is completely unethical.Even though he knew that he would be living the office in two or three weeks, he tried to shove off the responsibility that was given to him by telling lies.

The most important factors when it comes to doing our job properly is to be honest and dedicated to the place we are working in.Here in the situation, we can see many traits of Charlie such as dishonesty,disregard and negligence to the employees of the company and to the company as a whole.


Since Charlie knows that he will be leaving the company in a while he has to inform the manager or the seniors in his company stating that he will be leaving so that it will also be helpful for the company to recruit someone in his place or make arrangements for his leaving the job.This also shows the lack of taking responsibility by Charlie because he did not want to do work for the company because he knew that he would be leaving in two or three weeks. Thinking that it would not make any impact or it would not give him any personal benefits he didn't think of conducting the meeting as early as possible.

This type of behavior should not be encouraged in the corporate world as people will start being irresponsible and we cannot hold anybody responsible if something goes wrong in the worst of the situations.To ensure that this doesn't happen among different employees of the company we should try to build comradery among each and every person working in the company and also try to have make them feel that they belong to the company and do work as if it's their own child instead of thinking it as some burden and then working just for the money.

People working in the company should be passionate towards their job.Honesty,integrity and passion towards the job and dedication are the most important traits and qualities that anybody looks in a person when he wants to hire them for the job. And Charlie was not up to the mark in all these qualities.

So in my opinion what Charlie did was wrong and he should have told the company manager that he would be leaving soon and finish of all his works that were remaining in the company and then leave gracefully instead of telling lies to his co-workers and then not doing the job that was assigned to him.
