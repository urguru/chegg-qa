        Maple, (Acer), any of a large genus (about 200 species) of shrubs or
        trees in the family Sapindaceae, widely distributed in the North
        Temperate Zone but concentrated in China. Maples constitute one of the
        most important groups of ornamentals for planting in lawns, along
        streets, and in parks. All maples bear pairs of winged seeds, called
        samaras or keys. The leaves are arranged oppositely on twigs. Many
        maples have lobed leaves, but a few have leaves separated into
        leaflets.A few different species of maple trees are described below

        <h2>Japenese Maple</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_palmatum"
            >Japenese Maple</a
          >
          is common maple found in many landscapes is the Japanese maple (Acer
          palmatum). Japanese maples offer an almost infinite variety of forms
          due to the many cultivars and are hardy in USDA zones 5 through 8.
          They can be trained into various shapes, left to grow on their own, or
          any combination in between, and do well inside containers. A typical
          Japanese maple can grow to be 25 feet tall, with some cultivars
          growing as large shrubs. They prefer rich, well-drained soil and
          partially shady locations.

        <h2>Norway Maple</h2>
        <p>
          The majestic
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_platanoides"
            >Norway maple</a
          >
          (Acer platonoides) is frequently planted along city streets, as shade
          trees in front of homes, and in parks nationwide. It's a hardy and
          vigorous growing tree that can withstand all the indignities of being
          planted next to a road, as well as extreme heat and cold, droughts,
          car exhaust fumes, and road salt near their roots. The tree is
          considered invasive in some locations due to its widespread dispersal
          of seeds. Plant Norway maples in USDA zones 4 to 7 in full sun or
          partially shady areas. They can grow up to 50 feet tall and they do
          spread out, so leave plenty of room between the Norway maple and
          nearby structures. They're very drought tolerant.

        <h2>Sugar Maple</h2>
        <p>
          The native and deciduous
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_maple">Sugar Maple</a>
          (Acer saccharum) is responsible for the production of mouth-watering
          maple syrup and is hardy in USDA zones 3 through 8. Known for its
          glorious fall colors, the leaves turn spectacular shades of bright
          orange, yellow and red. This is also one of the tallest maples,
          growing up to 120-feet tall and 50-feet wide, so they need plenty of
          room to spread out. It grows best in full to partial sun and in a
          variety of well-drained soils, but requires frequent water especially
          during hot and dry weather.

        <h2>Paperback Maple</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_griseum"
            >Paperbark maple</a
          >
          (Acer griseum) gets its name from the rich, coppery-brownish bark that
          peels along the trunk and branches year-round making the tree an
          eye-catching specimen. The maple can take years to reach its mature
          height of 25-feet. Most trees have multiple trunks forming low to the
          ground, but can be pruned to have a single trunk. It has a deciduous
          habit and during fall the foliage turns a brilliant shade of red.
          Paperbarks are hardy in USDA zones 5 through 8 and grow in a sunny or
          partially shady location in well-drained, fertile soil.

        <h2>Red Maple</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_maple">Red Maple</a> (Acer
          rubrum) are native to eastern portions of the U.S. and tolerate warmer
          conditions than many maple types, being hardy in USDA zones 3 through
          9. The tree quickly reaches a mature height of 75-feet and makes an
          attractive shade or specimen tree. Due to its habit of forming surface
          roots, plant the tree away from house foundations or sidewalks.
          Deciduous red maples are one of the first trees to announce the coming
          of fall and puts on a riot of color with its red foliage.As with most
          maples, it is susceptible to a host of diseases and pests.
